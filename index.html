        <h2>The web should be <span class="special-text">fluid</span></h2>
        It's no secret that most web traffic today is coming from mobile devices.
        A good site or web app should look great on every screen.
        By using a "Mobile First" approach,
        I ensure that your software is both usable and aesthetically pleasing on every device.

        <h2>The web should be <span class="special-text">intuitive</span></h2>
        The last thing you want is for your users to walk away in frustration. 
        By using well established and proven design patterns I make sure your user interface makes sense and works for everyone.<br>

        <h2>The web should be <span class="special-text">fast</span></h2>
        The average internet user will wait about 2 seconds at most for content to load before clicking the back button.
        Through experience and careful planning, I can create engaging experiences and robust web software that preforms nearly as fast as a native app.<br>

    <div class="section-text">
        <h2>The web should <span class="special-text">work</span></h2>
        Last but not least, the web should work for its users.
        No software will every be perfect, and downtime will never be a thing of the past.
        However, I believe that though diligence and prudence, we can build a better, more stable web experiences for everyone.
