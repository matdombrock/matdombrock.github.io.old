* Since marijuana is still a illegal on a federal level, it is very difficult for legitimate cannabis retailers to effectively use social media for advertising. Most popular social media sites simply do not allow it and will ban any accounts thought to be connected to a cannabis retailer. They needed a way to inform customers of their in-store promotions, and a privately hosted website is currently the best and safest way to do that.
